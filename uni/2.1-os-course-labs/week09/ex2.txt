To maximize hit/miss ratio, we need to minimize miss count.
Main rule of how to do it, is to minimize number of different references between two references of same page.

F.e., we can access pages in cycle, assuming that overall number of pages less or equals number of available page frames in memory.

1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
Page frames number: 5

In such example, there will be just 5 first misses, all other will be hits, as all pages (1-5) will be present in memory all the time
